# Data Structures Final Project 2017

## The objective
This goal of this project was to buid a database that takes SQL commands,
and implements a Btree for indexing.

This project was built utilizing the simple-sql-parser (I take no credit for this module) to parse commands 
and receive them in a fashion that we can build.
